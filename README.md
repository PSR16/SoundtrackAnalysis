# Soundtrack Analysis

There are several potential goals for this project:

1. Find a way to suggest various soundtracks or individual tracks for users based on their favorite music from movie and/or video game soundtracks. 
  
  Oftentimes, the suggested music from Spotify is a selection of "covers" instead of new, original music. These "covers" are performances or renditions of a a previously recorded song or piece of music. This program would use data solely from originally recorded soundtracks, and based on information from each individual track (pitches, keys, tempos, etc), ultimately return a more accurate list of tracks the user may be interested. 

2. Develop interesting visualizations of tracks and compare music from different composers, movies and genres, etc. 

Different movies and video game genres have different styles of music composed for them. It would be interesting to see how the "mood" and music relationship exists in a movie or video game.
